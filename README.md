# Calculus-for-CS

Complete proofs to complement the first-year calculus course in the Computing (**not** Mathematics) degree at Imperial College London.

I will aim to include proofs/discussions for the following
- Limits and convergence of sequences
- Completeness
- Limits and convergence of continuous functions
- Continuity
- Differentiation and differentiability
- Riemann integration and integrability
- Series and tests for convergence
- Power series

Depending on time, I may also include proofs for later chapters such as multivariate calculus and metric spaces.

Feedback/corrections are welcome.
