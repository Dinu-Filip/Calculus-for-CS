# Calculus-for-CS

Complete proofs to complement the first-year calculus course in the Computing (**not** Mathematics) degree at Imperial College London.

I will aim to include proofs/discussions for the following
- Limits and convergence of sequences
- Elementary results on Dedekind-completeness
- Limits and convergence of continuous functions
- Continuity
- Differentiation
- Elementary results on Riemann integration
- Series and tests for convergence
- Power series

Depending on time, I may also include proofs for later chapters such as multivariate calculus and metric spaces.

Feedback/corrections are welcome.
